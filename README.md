## Suggested Repos


### Artificial Intelligence

[AI Plays Gomuku](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-Gomuku):- An Artificially Intelligent game playing agent for the game of Gomuku. Gomuku is a 5 in a row game played on 15x15 board. Uses Minimax Algorithm to find the best move possible and alpha beta pruning to avoid expanding unnecessary nodes in the game tree.

[AI Plays GTA 5](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-GTA-5):- An artificially intelligent self-driving agent for the game of GTA 5. A method of image segmentation with CNN was used to classify different objects within an urban scape. Used an open source CNN architecture called U-Net, developed by the university of Freiberg. Implemented trajectory generation feature and drive algorithm to drive the vehicle autonomously once the position of the lane is predicted.


### Robotics
