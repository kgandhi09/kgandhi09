## Suggested Repos


### Artificial Intelligence

[AI Plays Gomuku](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-Gomuku):- An Artificially Intelligent game playing agent for the game of Gomuku. Gomuku is a 5 in a row game played on 15x15 board. Uses Minimax Algorithm to find the best move possible and alpha beta pruning to avoid expanding unnecessary nodes in the game tree.

[AI Plays GTA 5](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-GTA-5):- An artificially intelligent self-driving agent for the game of GTA 5. A method of image segmentation with CNN was used to classify different objects within an urban scape. Uses an open source CNN architecture called U-Net, developed by the university of Freiberg. Has a trajectory generation feature and drive algorithm to drive the vehicle autonomously once the position of the lane is predicted.


### Robotics

[Unknown Environment Mapping - ROS](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Unknown_Environment_Mapping-ROS):- A turtlebot 3 explores and navigates an unknown environment of maze and maps it. Uses Gmapping, a laser based SLAM package to extract information of current epxlored map in form of occupancy grid, finds interesting frontiers to drive to further explore the map. Uses A* algorithm to optimally drive the turtlebot to the interested frontiers. Also, uses custom navigational nodes instead of move_base package.

[Robotic Pick and Place](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Robotic_Pick_and_Place):- A robotic arm that detects various objects in its workspace using machine vision, picks them, places them outside the workspace in a predefined area and sorts them based on appearances. Uses DH-convention for forward kinematics to control the tip of the robot, gemometric based approach for inverse kinematics to calculate joint angle values, jacobian matrix for differential kinematics to calculate the forward velocity kinematics, cubic polynomial and quintic polynomial method for trajectory planning and energy-based Lagrangian method for force-torque relationship to fight gravity. 

### AI powered UAV:-
