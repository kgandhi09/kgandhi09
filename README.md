## Suggested Repos


### Artificial Intelligence

[AI Plays Gomuku](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-Gomuku):- An Artificially Intelligent game playing agent for the game of Gomuku. Uses Minimax Algorithm to find the best move possible and alpha beta pruning to avoid expanding unnecessary nodes in the game tree.

[AI Plays GTA 5](https://github.com/kgandhi09/AI-Plays-GTA-5):- An artificially intelligent self-driving agent for the game of GTA 5. A method of image segmentation with CNN was used to classify different objects within an urban scape. Uses an open source CNN architecture called U-Net, developed by the university of Freiberg. Has a trajectory generation feature and drive algorithm to drive the vehicle autonomously once the position of the lane is predicted.


### Robotics

[Unknown Environment Mapping - ROS](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Unknown_Environment_Mapping-ROS):- A turtlebot 3 explores and navigates an unknown environment of maze and maps it using ROS. 

[Robotic Pick and Place](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Robotic_Pick_and_Place):- A robotic arm that detects various objects in its workspace using machine vision, picks them, places them outside the workspace in a predefined area and sorts them based on appearances.

### AI powered UAV

[Indoor Autonomous Drone Flight](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Indoor_Autonomous_Drone_Flight):- Autnomous drone flight system in an indoor environment with no access to GPS signals. Uses overhead camera attached with the ground station and a computer vision algorithm for localization, channel override method to manipulate the pwm signals of each channel (throttle, roll, pitch and yaw) for navigation, pixhawk's internal gyro data and a self-stabilizing algorithm to self-stabilize the drone, and a two-way TCP socket com to communicate the data between ground station and the drone. 

### Application Development

[Covid 19 Assisstant APP (Android)](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Covid-19_Assisstant_App):- An android application that relies on user reported data to report and keep track of people not following rules and regulations through a scoring system, unsanitized places through AR signs and a daily log of places visited & people met.

[Internal Navigation Appp for Brigham & Women's Hospital (Desktop Application)](https://github.com/kgandhi09/Brigham-and-Women-s-hospital-Navigation-App):-
